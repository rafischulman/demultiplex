This code is a demultiplexer, originally designed for single cell methylation data generated by the scRRBs protocol.

Use Cases:
-Given fastq and barcodes, split into cell-specific fastq files
-Given fastq, determine most likely barcodes and split into cell specific fastq files
-Check validity of set of barcodes

- Determine paired or single end
- Identify location of barcode in read
- Set/abide by naming convensions 
- Easy merging of fastqs
